This is a small amateur project made for learning purposes in our free 
time by a team of two. Despite we have a lot of nice ideas, we are 
students and can't dedicate the time we wanted to develop it, so we 
cannot promise big or frequent updates. Also none of us have English as 
mother tongue, we apologize for possible mistakes. Have fun!
